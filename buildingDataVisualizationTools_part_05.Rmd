## How to create custom graphics/ visualizations

The core package behind the graphics capabilities in R is the `grDevices` package, considered as the __engine__ for graphics/ visualizations in R. Two packages are built directly on this engine, the `graphics` and the `grid` packages, representing two __different__ and __incompatible__ graphic systems (see picture below for more information).

The `ggplot2` package is built on top of the `grid` graphic system. And the `grid` package provides the primitive functions that are used by `ggplot2` for creating and drawing complete plots. While it is not required to interact directly with the `grid` package, it is necessary to understand how it does work in order to be able to add customization not supported by `ggplot2`.

### The `grid` package and the `grid` graphic system

As stated in the "Introduction to grid" vignette [3]  

> "__grid__ is a low-level graphics system which provides a great deal of control and flexibility in the appearance and arrangement of graphical output. grid does not provide high-level functions which create complete plots. What it does provide is a basis for developing such high-level functions (e.g., the lattice and ggplot2 packages), the facilities for customising and manipulating lattice output, the ability to produce high-level plots or non-statistical images from scratch, and the ability to add sophisticated annotations to the output from base graphics functions (see the gridBase package)."

The `grid` graphic system provides only low-level graphic functions that can be used to create basic graphical features and it does not provide __high level functions__ for producing complete plots. Please note that there are two different families of functions in the `grid` package

- `*Grob()` family of functions, used to create __grobs__ as R objects, and
- `grid.*()` family of functions, used to create __grobs__ as graphical output.

The main focus in this blog is to use __grobs__ as R objects. The __list of the `*Grob()` family of functions__ used for such purpouse can be found below

```{r grobFamily}
ls(name = "package:grid", pattern = ".*Grob")
```

__Note!__ It is possible to use these low-level functions to create complete plots (not recommended), see the following (grid) scatterplot example (adapted from [2]).

```{r scatterplotExample}
# create a scatterplots equivalent to 
# plot(1:10)

# create and draw a rectangle - line type = dashed
gRect1 <- grid::rectGrob(gp = grid::gpar(lty = "dashed"))
grid.draw(gRect1)
# create the data points
x <- y <- 1:10
# create a viewport providing the margins as number of text lines
vp1 <- grid::plotViewport(c(5.1,4.1,4.1,2.1))
# navigate into the created viewport
grid::pushViewport(vp1)
# create a viewport with x and y scales
# based on provided values
dvp1 <- grid::dataViewport(x,y)
# navigate into the created viewport
grid::pushViewport(dvp1)
# create and draw a rectangle
gRect2 <- grid::rectGrob()
grid.draw(gRect2)
# create and draws the x and y axis
gXaxis <- grid::xaxisGrob()
grid.draw(gXaxis)
gYaxis <- grid::yaxisGrob()
grid.draw(gYaxis)
# create and draw the data points
gPoints <- grid::pointsGrob(x,y)
grid.draw(gPoints)
# create and draw text
gYText <- grid::textGrob("y = 1:10", x = grid::unit(-3, "lines"), rot = 90)
grid.draw(gYText)
gXText <- grid::textGrob("x = 1:10", y = grid::unit(-3, "lines"))
grid.draw(gXText)
# exit the 2 viewports
grid::popViewport(2)
```


### The `grid` graphic system: basic concepts

#### __Grobs__: graphical objects

The most critical concept to understand is the concept of __grob__. A __grob__ is a __grid graphical object__ that can be created, changed and plotted using the grid graphic functions. __Grobs__ can be created and then 

- added or removed from larger grid objects including ggplot objects and 
- drawn on a graphic device when a grid graphic plot is printed.

Possible __grobs__ that can be created include circles, lines, points, rectangles, polygons, etc. Once a __grob__ is created, it can be modified (using the `editGrob` function) and then drawn (using the `grid.draw` function). See examples below.

```{r circleExample1}
# Create a circle grob object and draw it in the current device
# See ?circleGrob for possible arguments and default values

grid.newpage() # Erase/ clear the current device
the_circle <- circleGrob() # Create the circe grob
grid.draw(the_circle) # Draw the grob (current device)
```

```{r circleExample2}
# Create a circle grob object with specific settings (center and radius)
# modify the object (center and radius) and draw it
grid.newpage()
the_circle <- circleGrob(x = 0.2, y = 0.2, r = 0.2)
the_circle <- editGrob(the_circle, 
                       x = unit(0.8, "npc"), 
                       y = unit(0.8, "npc"), 
                       r = unit(0.2, "npc"))
grid.draw(the_circle)
```

```{r circleExample3}
# Create a circle grob object
# using the power of vectorization 
grid.newpage() # Erase/ clear the current device
the_circle <- circleGrob(
  x = seq(0.1, 0.9, length = 100),
  y = 0.5 + 0.3 * sin(seq(0, 2*pi, length = 100)),
  r = abs(0.1 * cos(seq(0, 2*pi, length = 100)))
)
grid.draw(the_circle)
```

More grob objects can be plot on the same device as part of the same visualization/ graph, your fantasy becomes your limit ...

```{r grobsExample1}
grid.newpage() # Erase/ clear the current device

outer_rectangle <- rectGrob()
my_circle <- circleGrob(x = 0.5, y = 0.5, r = 0.4, 
                        gp = gpar(col = "blue", lty = 2))
my_rect <- rectGrob(width = 0.9, height = 0.2,
                    gp = gpar(col = "red", lty = 3))

grid.draw(outer_rectangle)
grid.draw(my_circle)
grid.draw(my_rect)
```


```{r grobsExample2}
grid.newpage() # Erase/ clear the current device
outer_rectangle <- rectGrob(gp = gpar(lty = 3))
curve_1 <- curveGrob(x1 = 0.1, y1 = 0.25, x2 = 0.3, y2 = 0.75)
curve_2 <- curveGrob(x1 = 0.4, y1 = 0.25, x2 = 0.6, y2 = 0.75, square = F, ncp = 8, curvature = 0.5)
curve_3 <- curveGrob(x1 = 0.7, y1 = 0.25, x2 = 0.9, y2 = 0.75, square = F, angle = 45, shape = -1)

grid.draw(outer_rectangle)
grid.draw(curve_1)
grid.draw(curve_2)
grid.draw(curve_3)
```
